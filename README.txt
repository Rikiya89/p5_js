# Daily p5.js Practice

This repository gathers my day-to-day coding exercises built with p5.js. Each sketch lives in its own folder so I can track progress and experiments over time.

## Directory overview

* `2025xxxx/` folders: date-stamped sketches with `index.html`, `sketch.js`, and any notes for that day.
* `Flower_Arrangement/`: a standalone sketch kept for reference.
* `p5_js/`: a minimal starter set of files I reuse when beginning a new idea.
* `addons/`, `p5.js`, `p5.min.js`: local copies of the libraries required by the sketches.
* `empty-example/`: the blank template I clone when I want a clean starting point.

## How to run

1. Open a terminal inside the sketch folder you want to explore.
2. Start a lightweight HTTP server (for example, `python -m http.server`).
3. Visit the served `index.html` in your browser to view the sketch.
